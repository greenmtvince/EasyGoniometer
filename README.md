# EasyGoniometer

Capstone project for the Udacity Android Developer Program.  This project allowed students to choose their own real world problem their app would solve.  In the first phase of the project, students had to create the business case, develop the specifications, build wireframes, and create a project plan.  The second part of the project involved actually programming the app with a web backend hosted on Google Firebase.

This app functions as a Goniometer a tool orthopedists and phyiscal therapists use to measure range of motion of joints. In particular, it was developed for post-knee replacement surgery patients who often describe both wanting to make progress in their recovery and understand how well they were doing.  Using the onboard accelerometers and gyros of an android device, the user can take measurements of their knee range of motion and see the results over time charted out.
